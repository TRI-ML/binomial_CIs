The tests are written in the form of interactive notebooks.

- `binom_helper_validation.ipynb`: This notebook is to validate the binomial helper functions from `binomial_cis/binomial_helper.py`. Accuracy and speed of our implementation is tested against the SciPy implementation.
- `conf_set_validation.ipynb`: This notebook is to validate the probabilistic guarantees of the confidence intervals using Monte Carlo simulation.
- `2_side_validation.ipynb`: This notebook is to validate the implementation of the 2-sided confidence interval against the data tabulated in the appendix of [Table of Neyman-shortest unbiased confidence intervals for the binomial parameter](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2333308) by Blyth and Hutchinson. This is a work in progress.
